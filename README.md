# BlenderModels
When we started working with Unity, we realized that we should create our own assets that we require rather than 
going to Unity Store as many of them are not free and it may not be in the specification that we wanted.

Hence, I started experimenting with Blender to familiarize myself with 3D Modelling.
This repository consists of many models that I have created from scratch with inspirations from real life objects.
Some of them are painted.
